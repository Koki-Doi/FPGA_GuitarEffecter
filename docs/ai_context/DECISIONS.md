# Design decisions (ADR-style)

Each entry is a decision that earlier work made and that future work
should not silently revisit. New decisions go at the bottom; old ones do
not get removed even when superseded — they get updated.

---

## D1 — ADAU1761 ADC HPF is enabled by default

- **Decision.** `config_codec()` writes `R19_ADC_CONTROL = 0x03`, then
  uses RMW via `enable_adc_hpf()` to set R19[5], so the post-init value
  is `0x23`. A 300 ms settle is included before the DAC is enabled.
- **Why.** With the HPF off, capture-with-input-shorted showed a
  significant DC offset and elevated RMS. Toggling R19[5] removed the
  offset and dropped RMS dramatically, so the user requested it be the
  permanent default.
- **Important caveats.**
  - This is a ~2 Hz DC blocker, **not** a 20–40 Hz guitar low-cut.
    Treat it as an offset remover, nothing more.
  - The IIR has τ ≈ 80 ms at 48 kHz. After any toggle, allow ~3–4 τ
    (≈ 300 ms) before measurement, and discard the first ~50 ms of any
    capture (handled in `diagnostic_capture` with `settling_ms` and
    `discard_initial_frames`).
- **How to apply.** Never remove the `enable_adc_hpf()` call from
  `config_codec()`. If a future test needs it off, do it explicitly and
  restore the default.

## D2 — `block_design.tcl` is off-limits by default

- **Decision.** New control bits and new effect stages reuse the spare
  bytes of the existing `axi_gpio_*` IPs. Adding or reconfiguring an
  AXI GPIO requires a `block_design.tcl` change and explicit user
  approval.
- **Why.** The existing block design has timing margin already eaten
  (see `TIMING_AND_FPGA_NOTES.md`). Touching the block design risks
  regenerating addresses, breaking the C++/Python address map, and
  destabilising the build.
- **How to apply.** When asked for new control bits, look for a spare
  byte first (`GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`). Only escalate to a block-design
  change when the user agrees in writing.

## D3 — Deploys go through `scripts/deploy_to_pynq.sh`

- **Decision.** Any change that ships to the PYNQ-Z2 goes through that
  script, which uses SSH key auth and never stores a password.
- **Why.** Earlier ad-hoc `scp` flows risked interactive password
  prompts that the agent could not satisfy and risked desyncing the
  package install vs the bitstream.
- **How to apply.** Use the script. Override host or paths via env
  vars (`PYNQ_HOST`, `PYNQ_USER`, `PYNQ_REPO_DIR`, `PYNQ_NB_DIR`,
  `SSH_KEY`).

## D4 — PYNQ overlay work needs root

- **Decision.** Anything that touches `Overlay()`, DMA, `pynq.allocate`
  or the `/dev/uio*` devices runs as `sudo`. Use
  `sudo env PYTHONPATH=/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ python3 …`.
- **Why.** The PYNQ Linux image gates UIO and contiguous-memory
  allocation behind root. Trying to use the overlay as `xilinx`
  fails with surprising error messages that point in the wrong
  direction.

## D5 — Live package source is `/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ/`

- **Decision.** Always put `/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ` first on
  `PYTHONPATH` for board-side runs.
- **Why.** The PYNQ image carries an older copy of `audio_lab_pynq`
  under `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/`. Without the
  PYTHONPATH override the test may run the wrong code and silently
  succeed, hiding regressions.

## D6 — The `model_select` 8-way mux distortion plan is dead

- **Decision.** Selectable distortion models are implemented as
  independent pedal stages (each with its own enable bit), not as a
  numeric `model_select` driving a giant case statement. This
  decision shipped in commit `baa97ff`.
- **Why.** The `model_select` build pushed Vivado WNS from -7.722 ns
  to -15.067 ns. The combinational depth of the per-stage 8-way case
  was the cause; the design did not deploy safely in that shape. The
  pedal-mask replacement restored WNS to -7.801 ns and was deployed.
- **How to apply.** Read `DISTORTION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`. Do not add
  new `case modelSelect of …` blocks to `LowPassFir.hs`. Pedal
  enables live in `distortion_control.ctrlD`; the section master
  stays at `gate_control.ctrlA[2]`.

## D7 — Reference repositories are read-only inspiration

- **Decision.** Algorithmic structure of guitarix, BYOD, JS-Rocks,
  PunkMuff, ToobAmp, dm-Rat, etc. may be studied. Their **source
  code is not copied** into this repository.
- **Why.** Several of those projects are GPL-licensed. This
  repository is WTFPL. Pasting GPL code (whole or near-verbatim) is
  not compatible. Beyond the licence question, hand-rolling the Clash
  forces us to keep the implementation small enough to fit the FPGA.
- **How to apply.** No `git submodule add`, no `git clone` into the
  tree. If a reference is needed for a session, clone it into
  `/tmp` or another scratch path the repo never sees.

## D8 — `rat` pedal maps onto the existing RAT stage

- **Decision.** The `rat` entry in the new pedal-mask API does not
  add a new Clash stage. Instead, when bit 2 of
  `distortion_control.ctrlD` is set, the Python facade
  (`_apply_distortion_state_to_words`) also forces `gate_control`
  bit 4 high, engaging the existing RAT block (`ratHighpassFrame`
  through `ratMixFrame`).
- **Why.** The existing RAT implementation is a complete, tested,
  parameter-rich voicing. Re-implementing it inside the new
  pedal-mask pipeline would have duplicated logic, eaten timing,
  and produced a slightly different sound for no gain.
- **How to apply.** Do not add a `ratStyle*Frame` chain. If the
  user wants a different RAT-style flavour, expose it as a new
  pedal bit (e.g. an unused reserved slot) rather than rewriting
  the existing one.

## D9 — `ds1` / `big_muff` / `fuzz_face` reservation lifted; bits 3-5 are now implemented

- **Decision (original).** Bits 3, 4, 5 of `distortion_control.ctrlD`
  were reserved for `ds1`, `big_muff`, and `fuzz_face` while the
  Python API and notebook UI already accepted the names; the FPGA
  passed audio through bit-exact when only those bits were set.
- **Decision (current, `feature/add-reserved-distortion-pedals`).**
  All three reserved pedals now have working Clash stages in the
  deployed bitstream:
  - `ds1` (bit 3): 5 register stages — HPF -> mul -> asym soft clip
    with low knees -> post LPF -> level+safety. Voicing aim is
    BOSS DS-1 style edgy crunch.
  - `big_muff` (bit 4): 5 register stages — pre-gain -> softClipK
    medium knee -> softClipK tighter knee with ~0.75x gain ->
    tone LPF -> level+safety. Voicing aim is Big Muff Pi style
    cascaded soft clip with a darker top end.
  - `fuzz_face` (bit 5): 4 register stages — pre-gain -> strong
    asymSoftClip -> tone LPF -> level+safety. Voicing aim is
    Fuzz Face style raw asymmetric breakup; the TONE knob doubles
    as a "round vs. bright" axis since real Fuzz Faces typically
    lack a tone control.
  Each block is gated by its own enable predicate (`ds1On` /
  `bigMuffOn` / `fuzzFaceOn`); when the bit is clear every stage is
  bit-exact bypass. The new sections slot into `fxPipeline` after
  `metalLevelPipe`, with `distortionPedalsPipe = fuzzFaceLevelPipe`.
- **Why the original reservation was kept.** Locking the bit
  positions early kept the GPIO layout and Python API stable across
  the staged rollout, so the implementation work was a pure code
  addition: no GPIO shuffle, no Python API churn, no notebook
  rewrite of the per-pedal pipeline.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from BOSS DS-1 schematics-exact
    coefficient tables, the public Big Muff Pi schematic, or
    Dallas Arbiter / Dunlop Fuzz Face circuit transcriptions, nor
    from any GPL DSP project (guitarix, BYOD, JS-Rocks,
    PunkMuff, dm-Rat, ToobAmp, etc.). Algorithmic shape (HPF ->
    drive -> clip -> post LPF -> level, soft / hard / asym clip
    helper choice, cascaded soft clip for Muff-style fuzz, low-knee
    asym clip for fuzz-face-style breakup) is the only thing taken
    (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** new GPIO. Bit 7 of the pedal mask remains the only
    reserved slot, held for a future 8th pedal.
  - **No** revival of the 8-way `model_select` mux structure; each
    pedal stays in its own register-staged block (`DECISIONS.md`
    D6 / `TIMING_AND_FPGA_NOTES.md`).
  - **No** new C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Implementation went Python API + UI relabel -> Clash
    stages directly.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing a `ds1` / `big_muff` / `fuzz_face` voicing, edit
    the matching `ds1*Frame` / `bigMuff*Frame` / `fuzzFace*Frame`
    block in `LowPassFir.hs`. Do not introduce a wider case over
    pedal selectors; each block is independently enabled.
  - The Python API surface (`set_distortion_pedal`,
    `set_distortion_pedals`, `set_distortion_settings(pedal=...)`)
    is unchanged; the only public change is that
    `DISTORTION_PEDALS_IMPLEMENTED` now lists every pedal name.
  - Notebook reserved-pedal warning banners are dropped. Keep the
    legacy `*_reserved` PEDAL_LABEL_TO_API aliases pointing at the
    implemented pedals so older live notebook sessions still work.

## D11 — Noise suppressor lives on its own AXI GPIO; legacy gate is replaced

- **Decision.** A dedicated `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` IP at
  `0x43CC0000` carries THRESHOLD / DECAY / DAMP / mode for a BOSS
  NS-2 / NS-1X-style noise suppressor. The Clash side replaces the
  legacy hard noise gate stages (`gateLevelPipe -> gateEnv -> gateOpen
  -> gateGain -> gatePipe`) with new envelope + smoothed-gain stages
  (`nsLevelPipe -> nsEnv -> nsGain -> nsPipe`). Enable still rides on
  `gate_control` bit 0 (the legacy `noise_gate_on` flag).
- **Why.** The legacy noise gate exposed a single hard threshold whose
  Python 0..100 range collapsed onto 0..10 in practice and chopped
  signal at the close transition. NS-2 / NS-1X-style THRESHOLD /
  DECAY / DAMP gives users a smoothed close ramp and a controllable
  closed-gain floor while staying cheap on the FPGA (one envelope
  register feedback + one smoothed-gain register feedback + one
  saturating multiply, same shape as the legacy gate).
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** RNNoise / FFT / spectral subtraction. Way too heavy for the
    PYNQ-Z2 PL budget; the suppressor is purely a smoothed time-domain
    gate.
  - **No** copying of source code from BOSS units, JS-Rocks NS-style
    blocks, or `noise-suppression-for-voice` / `libspecbleach` /
    similar GPL projects. Algorithmic shape (envelope follower,
    threshold compare, smoothed gain, damp closed-gain floor) is the
    only thing taken from the references.
- **Threshold scale change.** Python `noise_gate_threshold` is now on a
  one-tenth scale: byte = `round(threshold * 255 / 1000)`, so the new
  100 maps to the legacy 10 byte. `set_guitar_effects(noise_gate_threshold=...)`
  uses the same scaling and mirrors the byte to both the legacy
  `gate_control.ctrlB` slot (dead in the new bitstream, kept for
  backward compatibility) and the new `noise_suppressor_control.ctrlA`.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing the noise stage, edit the `ns*` block in
    `LowPassFir.hs`. Do **not** revive the legacy `gateGainNext` /
    `gateFrame` registers in the active pipeline.
  - `block_design.tcl` carries the new GPIO; any further GPIO change
    must keep `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` and its address `0x43CC0000`
    intact so overlays match.
  - Reserved knobs (mode byte, attack, hold, NS-2 vs NS-1X switch)
    should land on `noise_suppressor_control.ctrlD` rather than
    grabbing more bytes from existing GPIOs.

## D12 — GPIO design is fixed; effect refactors do not move bytes

- **Decision.** Once a GPIO has been deployed (name, address, and the
  meaning of `ctrlA` / `ctrlB` / `ctrlC` / `ctrlD`), refactors must
  not move it. Adding a new effect should land on a `reserved` byte
  / bit already documented in `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`. Adding a new
  `axi_gpio_*` IP is a last resort and requires explicit user
  approval (D2 still applies).
- **Why.** Multiple deployed bitstreams already carry this address
  map. Renaming or shuffling bytes risks silently breaking older
  bitstreams in the field (cf. `axi_gpio_delay`, which is named for
  a delay but drives the RAT — and cannot be renamed without a
  block-design change). Locking the layout also keeps Python /
  Clash / notebook / tests in lock-step.
- **How to apply.**
  - When you reach `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`, treat the table as a
    contract; never edit a row's address or its `ctrlA`-`ctrlD`
    semantics in the same change as a refactor.
  - If a refactor "wants" to rename a GPIO, propose a follow-up
    change instead and flag it for user approval.
  - The shipped exception is `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` at
    `0x43CC0000` (D11). Any future exception goes through the same
    gate.

## D13 — C++ DSP prototypes were removed from the active tree

- **Decision.** The earlier `src/effects/*.cpp` files
  (`RatStyleDistortion`, `SimpleAmpSimulator`, `CabIRSimulator`)
  were removed, along with their CPU-side tests
  (`tests/test_rat_style_distortion.cpp`,
  `tests/test_amp_cab_simulators.cpp`). The single source of truth
  for DSP behaviour on the live build is
  `hw/ip/clash/src/LowPassFir.hs`.
- **Why.** The C++ files were only reference implementations and
  never ran on the PYNQ-Z2 audio path. Their continued presence in
  the tree invited the "implement in C++ then port" pattern, which
  is not how this project ships effects — every effect is built
  directly in Clash for fixed-point + pipelined synthesis. Keeping
  the prototypes also confused agents and humans into believing
  `make tests` validated the FPGA path, which it never did.
- **How to apply.**
  - New effects start at the Python / UI / Clash layer; do not
    introduce a new C++ prototype.
  - Algorithm shape from GPL projects (guitarix, BYOD, etc.) is
    fair to reference (D7); their source is not.
  - `make tests` now runs Python tests only. `make cpp_tests` /
    `make test_cpp` are deprecated targets that print a notice
    instead of running anything.

## D14 — Compressor lives on its own AXI GPIO

- **Decision.** A dedicated `axi_gpio_compressor` IP at `0x43CD0000`
  carries THRESHOLD / RATIO / RESPONSE / enable+MAKEUP for a stereo-
  linked feed-forward peak compressor. The Clash side adds a new
  `compressor_control` port and a `compLevelPipe -> compEnv ->
  compGain -> compApplyPipe -> compMakeupPipe` block between the
  noise suppressor and the overdrive. Enable lives **inside this
  GPIO** (`ctrlD` bit 7), not on `gate_control.ctrlA`.
- **Why.**
  - The compressor needed five distinct knobs (threshold / ratio /
    response / makeup / enable). Stuffing them onto an existing
    `reserved` byte / bit was not possible:
    `axi_gpio_distortion.ctrlD[3..5,7]` is held for the reserved
    distortion pedals (`DECISIONS.md` D9),
    `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor.ctrlD` is held for NS-2 vs NS-1X
    mode / attack / hold (D11), `axi_gpio_eq.ctrlD` is held for a
    future EQ-section knob. Repurposing any of those would violate
    `DECISIONS.md` D12.
  - `gate_control.ctrlA` is the master flag byte and every bit is
    already owned by an existing effect's enable. Adding a new
    flag bit there would touch the meaning of an `active` byte,
    which D12 forbids.
  - The compressor benefits from being able to flip its own enable
    without read-modify-write on a shared flag byte; keeping the
    enable inside its own GPIO makes the section fully self-
    contained.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from the references studied for
    parameter naming and design philosophy: harveyf2801/AudioFX-
    Compressor, bdejong/musicdsp simple compressor, DanielRudrich/
    SimpleCompressor, chipaudette/OpenAudio_ArduinoLibrary,
    p-hlp/SMPLComp (GPL-3.0), Ashymad/bancom (GPL-3.0). Algorithmic
    structure (feed-forward peak detect, stereo link, gain
    reduction computer, envelope follower, makeup) is the only
    thing taken (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** lookahead, knee, multiband, sidechain input, or
    dB/log-domain math. The first compressor build is intentionally
    a 1-GPIO, light-weight ggitar-friendly section.
  - **No** C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Implementation went Python API + UI reservation -> Clash
    stage -> new GPIO directly.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing the compressor stage, edit the `comp*` block in
    `LowPassFir.hs`. Do not move or rename the block;
    `axi_gpio_compressor` and the `compressor_control` port are
    pinned by `block_design.tcl` and the deployed `.hwh`.
  - Reserved knobs (sidechain HPF, knee, mix, lookahead, attack and
    release as separate parameters) should land on a new GPIO via
    a new ADR rather than steal bytes from existing GPIOs.
  - The Python `set_compressor_settings(...)` API and the byte
    encoding in `control_maps.compressor_word` /
    `control_maps.makeup_to_u7` are the source of truth; keep
    notebook and tests in lock-step.

## D15 — Chain presets are Python/UI only, never new GPIO

- **Decision.** Practical pedalboard voicings ship as named entries in
  `effect_presets.CHAIN_PRESETS` and are applied via the Python
  facade (`AudioLabOverlay.apply_chain_preset`). They orchestrate the
  existing per-section setters and `set_guitar_effects`; they do
  **not** introduce new AXI GPIOs, new Clash stages, or new bitstream
  artefacts.
- **Why.** The chain-preset work is a usability layer on top of an
  already-deployed bitstream. Adding a new GPIO would force a full
  Vivado / Clash rebuild, a timing review, and a new bit/hwh deploy
  for what is essentially a curated lookup table. Keeping presets in
  Python also makes them easy to edit, snapshot-test, and iterate on
  without touching hardware.
- **Safety guarantees in the preset table.**
  - Compressor `makeup` is held to the 45..60 band (~unity to ~1.25x)
    in every preset, so flipping presets cannot produce a sudden
    volume jump that blows the rest of the chain.
  - Distortion `level` is capped at 35 in every preset.
  - The `Safe Bypass` preset has every section's `enabled=False` and
    `reverb.mix=0`. Tests enforce both.
- **How to apply.**
  - When adding a new preset, append it to `CHAIN_PRESETS` with one
    entry per section (`compressor` / `noise_suppressor` /
    `overdrive` / `distortion` / `amp` / `cab` / `eq` / `reverb`).
    The notebook picks it up automatically through
    `get_chain_preset_names()`.
  - Keep makeup in 45..60 and distortion `level` <= 35 unless you
    have a specific reason and update the safety tests in lock-step.
  - Do not introduce a new GPIO or a new Clash stage from this layer
    -- if a preset wants behaviour the FPGA does not currently
    expose, file it as a separate ADR (D11 / D14 style) instead.

## D16 — Real-pedal voicing pass tunes existing stages, never adds new ones

- **Decision.** Effect voicings can be moved closer to recognised
  real-pedal voicings (TS / RAT / MT-2 / Dyna Comp / NS-2 / cab IR /
  pedal reverb) by editing the constants and clip-helper choice
  inside the existing register stages of `LowPassFir.hs`. A voicing
  pass must **not** add a new GPIO, a new `topEntity` port, a new
  Clash register stage, or a new effect block. Reserved bytes / bits
  documented in `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md` stay reserved.
- **Why.**
  - Adding a GPIO or a new stage forces a `block_design.tcl` change
    (forbidden by D2 without explicit user approval) and re-opens
    timing risk that the pedal-mask refactor (D6 / `model_select`
    post-mortem) already paid down.
  - Existing chain presets and the public Python API are
    byte-for-byte compatible across the voicing pass: the bytes the
    notebook writes to each GPIO are unchanged, only the meaning
    given to those bytes by the live Clash bitstream shifts. Users
    keep the same control range and the same slider numbers.
  - The reference style for each effect is documented in
    `REAL_PEDAL_VOICING_TARGETS.md` so future passes have a clear
    "did the change land in the intended direction?" check.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from Tube Screamer / RAT / MT-2 /
    Dyna Comp / NS-2 / NS-1X schematics-exact coefficient tables, or
    GPL DSP projects. Algorithmic shape (HPF -> drive -> clip ->
    post LPF -> level, soft / hard / asym clip choice, hysteresis
    around a threshold, IR coefficient damping) is the only thing
    taken (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** new C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Voicing changes go directly into Clash.
  - **No** new lookahead, no new multi-band processing, no new
    spectral methods. The PL budget is what it is.
- **How to apply.**
  - Read `REAL_PEDAL_VOICING_TARGETS.md` before changing the voicing
    of an effect; record the new target / current / gap / plan rows
    in the same file.
  - Constant changes inside an existing stage are fine. Replacing
    `softClip` with `softClipK` / `asymSoftClip` / `hardClip` is
    fine. Changing a `mulU8` to a different gain expression is fine.
  - Adding a new register-staged block, a new `Frame` field, or a
    new `topEntity` port is **not** a voicing change; that is a new
    effect (case 4 in `EFFECT_ADDING_GUIDE.md`).
  - After any voicing pass that touches `LowPassFir.hs`: run
    `clash --vhdl`, repackage the IP via Vivado `create_ip.tcl`,
    rebuild bit/hwh, check timing, deploy, smoke-test all chain
    presets on the board.
  - The first voicing pass landed on the `feature/real-pedal-voicing-
    pass` branch and rebuilt the deployed bitstream from
    WNS = -7.516 ns to WNS = -6.405 ns (improved by 1.111 ns); hold
    stayed clean.

## D10 — `GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb` is the user-facing entry point

- **Decision.** A new two-cell notebook,
  `audio_lab_pynq/notebooks/GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb`, is the
  primary single-screen UI for the live chain. It exists alongside
  the existing `GuitarEffectSwitcher.ipynb` and
  `DistortionModelsDebug.ipynb`; none of them is being deprecated.
- **Why.** The existing switcher and debug notebooks have specific
  jobs (per-effect tweak / per-pedal walkthrough). The one-cell
  notebook is what a player should open: Apply / Safe Bypass /
  Refresh + four presets, with the distortion pedalboard as a
  first-class UI section.
- **How to apply.** Notebook-only edits land here; no
  bitstream rebuild needed. Reserved pedals stay selectable so the
  UI does not change shape when those Clash stages land later.

## D17 — Audio-analysis-driven voicing fixes tune existing stages only

- **Decision.** Recording-analysis-driven voicing fixes are implemented by
  retuning constants, coefficient tables, and clip-helper knees inside
  existing `LowPassFir.hs` stages. They must not add a new GPIO, a new
  `topEntity` port, a new `block_design.tcl` change, or a new selector
  topology.
- **Why.**
  - The recording analysis in `AUDIO_RECORDING_ANALYSIS.md` showed four
    actionable gaps: AmpSim had too much >5 kHz fizz, Cabinet roll-off
    was correct but still too weak for high-gain pedals, Overdrive was
    nearly indistinguishable from Bypass, and Compressor crest factor was
    almost unchanged.
  - The existing controls already expose the needed musical axes:
    Overdrive drive/tone/level, Compressor threshold/ratio/response/makeup,
    Amp input gain / master / presence / resonance / BMT / character, and
    Cab mix / level / model / air. Reusing them preserves the Python API
    and Notebook UI.
  - The design already runs with negative setup slack. A long cabinet IR,
    a new amp model selector, extra dB/log-domain processing, or a new
    GPIO would reopen timing and integration risk for a voicing problem.
- **What changed in the analysis pass.**
  - Amp: input gain ceiling trimmed again, post-clip pre-LPF darkened,
    treble and presence contribution capped harder, resonance/presence /
    power/master safety `softClipK` knees moved earlier.
  - Cab: the existing 4-tap coefficient table was rebuilt again with
    stronger model separation. Model 0 remains a lighter 1x12 open-back
    style, model 1 a balanced 2x12 combo style, and model 2 the darkest
    4x12 closed-back style for DS-1 / Metal / Big Muff / Fuzz.
  - Overdrive: drive mapping increased moderately, asymmetric clip knees
    lowered, and level output wrapped in a lower `softClipK` safety.
  - Compressor: effective threshold lowered, soft knee widened, reduction
    slope increased modestly, and response smoothing made more reactive.
  - Chain preset retune was numeric only: DS-1 Crunch now leans on Cab
    model 2 with capped air. Safe Bypass and safety caps are unchanged.
  - The deployed build kept `cabLevelMixFrame` on the existing
    timing-friendly `softClip`; a lower `softClipK 3_400_000` trial
    reached WNS = -9.891 ns and was not deployed.
  - Final deployed timing was WNS = -8.731 ns, TNS = -13665.555 ns,
    WHS = +0.051 ns, THS = 0.000 ns.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** commercial amp circuit constants, commercial cabinet IRs,
    pedal circuit coefficient tables, or schematic-derived coefficients
    were copied.
  - **No** GPL DSP code was moved into this WTFPL project.
  - **No** long FIR / convolution IR loader, dB/log math, lookahead,
    multiband compressor, amp model selector, new AXI GPIO, or revived
    C++ DSP prototype was added.
- **How to apply.**
  - Future voicing work should follow the loop: record -> analyze ->
    make the smallest existing-stage DSP change -> rebuild -> redeploy
    -> re-record / listen.
  - Keep Amp/Cab changes in `amp*Frame`, `ampAsymClip`, `cabCoeff`,
    `cabProductsFrame`, `cabIrFrame`, and `cabLevelMixFrame` unless the
    user explicitly approves a new topology.
  - Keep Overdrive changes in `overdriveDriveMultiplyFrame`,
    `overdriveDriveBoostFrame`, `overdriveDriveClipFrame`,
    `overdriveToneFrame` / tone blend, and `overdriveLevelFrame`.
  - Keep Compressor changes in `compThresholdSample`, `compTargetGain`,
    `compGainNext`, `compMakeupFrame`, and the existing compressor block.
  - Preserve every GPIO name, address, and `ctrlA` / `ctrlB` / `ctrlC` /
    `ctrlD` meaning from `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`.
  - After any `LowPassFir.hs` voicing change: regenerate VHDL, repackage
    IP, rebuild bit/hwh, check timing, deploy only if WNS remains in the
    accepted band and WHS/THS stay clean, then smoke-test chain presets.


## D18 — Amp Simulator named models reuse `amp_character`, never new GPIO

- **Decision.** The Amp Simulator section ships four named voicings —
  `jc_clean` / `clean_combo` / `british_crunch` / `high_gain_stack` —
  as a convenience layer on top of the existing `amp_character`
  knob. The Python side adds an `AMP_MODELS` table, `set_amp_model`,
  `get_amp_model_names`, and `amp_model_to_character` helpers; the
  Clash side quantises the same byte into a two-bit `ampModelSel`
  index that adds a tiny per-band darken to the post-clip pre-LPF.
  The numeric `amp_character` knob still works directly.
- **Why.**
  - Listening to the audio-analysis recordings showed that high-gain
    pedals into the amp produced a second top-end brightening at the
    same `amp_character` value that worked well for clean settings.
    Splitting the character byte into 4 bands gives each named voicing
    a slightly different LPF target without making `amp_character`
    discontinuous and without breaking the chain-preset / safe-bypass
    logic that already drives the byte directly.
  - Adding a separate GPIO or `topEntity` port for an amp model
    selector would have been a `block_design.tcl` change (forbidden
    by D2 without explicit user approval) and would also have eaten
    timing on a build that is already running with negative setup
    slack. Reusing the existing byte avoids both.
  - The `model_select` post-mortem (D6) still applies. The new
    `ampModelSel` is consumed in **one** stage only and only
    biases a single alpha constant, not a wide mux over independent
    multipliers / clippers / filters.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of commercial amp circuit constants, schematic-
    derived coefficients, or GPL DSP code (`DECISIONS.md` D7 / D11 /
    D14 / D17). The model names are inspirations only.
  - **No** new GPIO and **no** new `topEntity` port; the Frame shape
    is unchanged.
  - **No** model-specific switching of the asym clip knees, second-
    stage gain, presence cap, or resonance amount. Those stay
    continuously controlled by the existing `amp_character` /
    `amp_presence` / `amp_resonance` bytes; only the post-clip
    pre-LPF alpha is biased per band.
- **How to apply.**
  - Voicing tweaks to a specific amp model edit the matching band
    inside `ampPreLowpassFrame` (or extend `ampModelSel` to cover a
    second amp stage). Do not introduce a wide case over per-stage
    coefficient tables.
  - The Python `AMP_MODELS` mapping is the source of truth for the
    centre-of-band character values. Keep it in lock-step with the
    `ampModelSel` thresholds in `LowPassFir.hs` and the inline
    fallback inside `GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb`.
  - The `amp_character` numeric API stays public; `set_amp_model` is
    a thin wrapper around `set_guitar_effects(amp_character=...)`.
    Tests in `tests/test_overlay_controls.py` lock the mapping
    anchors and the per-model byte distinctness.
