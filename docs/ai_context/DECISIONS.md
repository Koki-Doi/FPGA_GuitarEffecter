# Design decisions (ADR-style)

Each entry is a decision that earlier work made and that future work
should not silently revisit. New decisions go at the bottom; old ones do
not get removed even when superseded — they get updated.

---

## D1 — ADAU1761 ADC HPF is enabled by default

- **Decision.** `config_codec()` writes `R19_ADC_CONTROL = 0x03`, then
  uses RMW via `enable_adc_hpf()` to set R19[5], so the post-init value
  is `0x23`. A 300 ms settle is included before the DAC is enabled.
- **Why.** With the HPF off, capture-with-input-shorted showed a
  significant DC offset and elevated RMS. Toggling R19[5] removed the
  offset and dropped RMS dramatically, so the user requested it be the
  permanent default.
- **Important caveats.**
  - This is a ~2 Hz DC blocker, **not** a 20–40 Hz guitar low-cut.
    Treat it as an offset remover, nothing more.
  - The IIR has τ ≈ 80 ms at 48 kHz. After any toggle, allow ~3–4 τ
    (≈ 300 ms) before measurement, and discard the first ~50 ms of any
    capture (handled in `diagnostic_capture` with `settling_ms` and
    `discard_initial_frames`).
- **How to apply.** Never remove the `enable_adc_hpf()` call from
  `config_codec()`. If a future test needs it off, do it explicitly and
  restore the default.

## D2 — `block_design.tcl` is off-limits by default

- **Decision.** New control bits and new effect stages reuse the spare
  bytes of the existing `axi_gpio_*` IPs. Adding or reconfiguring an
  AXI GPIO requires a `block_design.tcl` change and explicit user
  approval.
- **Why.** The existing block design has timing margin already eaten
  (see `TIMING_AND_FPGA_NOTES.md`). Touching the block design risks
  regenerating addresses, breaking the C++/Python address map, and
  destabilising the build.
- **How to apply.** When asked for new control bits, look for a spare
  byte first (`GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`). Only escalate to a block-design
  change when the user agrees in writing.

## D3 — Deploys go through `scripts/deploy_to_pynq.sh`

- **Decision.** Any change that ships to the PYNQ-Z2 goes through that
  script, which uses SSH key auth and never stores a password.
- **Why.** Earlier ad-hoc `scp` flows risked interactive password
  prompts that the agent could not satisfy and risked desyncing the
  package install vs the bitstream.
- **How to apply.** Use the script. Override host or paths via env
  vars (`PYNQ_HOST`, `PYNQ_USER`, `PYNQ_REPO_DIR`, `PYNQ_NB_DIR`,
  `SSH_KEY`).

## D4 — PYNQ overlay work needs root

- **Decision.** Anything that touches `Overlay()`, DMA, `pynq.allocate`
  or the `/dev/uio*` devices runs as `sudo`. Use
  `sudo env PYTHONPATH=/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ python3 …`.
- **Why.** The PYNQ Linux image gates UIO and contiguous-memory
  allocation behind root. Trying to use the overlay as `xilinx`
  fails with surprising error messages that point in the wrong
  direction.

## D5 — Live package source is `/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ/`

- **Decision.** Always put `/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ` first on
  `PYTHONPATH` for board-side runs.
- **Why.** The PYNQ image carries an older copy of `audio_lab_pynq`
  under `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/`. Without the
  PYTHONPATH override the test may run the wrong code and silently
  succeed, hiding regressions.

## D6 — The `model_select` 8-way mux distortion plan is dead

- **Decision.** Selectable distortion models are implemented as
  independent pedal stages (each with its own enable bit), not as a
  numeric `model_select` driving a giant case statement. This
  decision shipped in commit `baa97ff`.
- **Why.** The `model_select` build pushed Vivado WNS from -7.722 ns
  to -15.067 ns. The combinational depth of the per-stage 8-way case
  was the cause; the design did not deploy safely in that shape. The
  pedal-mask replacement restored WNS to -7.801 ns and was deployed.
- **How to apply.** Read `DISTORTION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`. Do not add
  new `case modelSelect of …` blocks to `LowPassFir.hs`. Pedal
  enables live in `distortion_control.ctrlD`; the section master
  stays at `gate_control.ctrlA[2]`.

## D7 — Reference repositories are read-only inspiration

- **Decision.** Algorithmic structure of guitarix, BYOD, JS-Rocks,
  PunkMuff, ToobAmp, dm-Rat, etc. may be studied. Their **source
  code is not copied** into this repository.
- **Why.** Several of those projects are GPL-licensed. This
  repository is WTFPL. Pasting GPL code (whole or near-verbatim) is
  not compatible. Beyond the licence question, hand-rolling the Clash
  forces us to keep the implementation small enough to fit the FPGA.
- **How to apply.** No `git submodule add`, no `git clone` into the
  tree. If a reference is needed for a session, clone it into
  `/tmp` or another scratch path the repo never sees.

## D8 — `rat` pedal maps onto the existing RAT stage

- **Decision.** The `rat` entry in the new pedal-mask API does not
  add a new Clash stage. Instead, when bit 2 of
  `distortion_control.ctrlD` is set, the Python facade
  (`_apply_distortion_state_to_words`) also forces `gate_control`
  bit 4 high, engaging the existing RAT block (`ratHighpassFrame`
  through `ratMixFrame`).
- **Why.** The existing RAT implementation is a complete, tested,
  parameter-rich voicing. Re-implementing it inside the new
  pedal-mask pipeline would have duplicated logic, eaten timing,
  and produced a slightly different sound for no gain.
- **How to apply.** Do not add a `ratStyle*Frame` chain. If the
  user wants a different RAT-style flavour, expose it as a new
  pedal bit (e.g. an unused reserved slot) rather than rewriting
  the existing one.

## D9 — `ds1` / `big_muff` / `fuzz_face` are reserved, not removed

- **Decision.** Bits 3, 4, 5 of `distortion_control.ctrlD` are
  reserved for `ds1`, `big_muff`, and `fuzz_face`. The Python API
  accepts these names today; the FPGA has no Clash stage for them
  yet, so audio passes through bit-exact when only those bits are
  set. The notebooks call this out in their reserved-pedal warnings.
- **Why.** Locking the bit positions now keeps the GPIO layout and
  the Python API stable across the staged rollout. Future Clash
  work for any of these voicings is a pure code addition; no GPIO
  shuffle, no Python API churn, no notebook rewrites.
- **How to apply.** When implementing one of the reserved pedals,
  add a small register-staged Clash block that consumes the
  matching bit, slot it into `fxPipeline` between `tube_screamer`
  and `metal`, and update the "implemented" list in
  `DISTORTION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` plus the warnings in the
  notebooks. Keep the Python API surface unchanged.

## D11 — Noise suppressor lives on its own AXI GPIO; legacy gate is replaced

- **Decision.** A dedicated `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` IP at
  `0x43CC0000` carries THRESHOLD / DECAY / DAMP / mode for a BOSS
  NS-2 / NS-1X-style noise suppressor. The Clash side replaces the
  legacy hard noise gate stages (`gateLevelPipe -> gateEnv -> gateOpen
  -> gateGain -> gatePipe`) with new envelope + smoothed-gain stages
  (`nsLevelPipe -> nsEnv -> nsGain -> nsPipe`). Enable still rides on
  `gate_control` bit 0 (the legacy `noise_gate_on` flag).
- **Why.** The legacy noise gate exposed a single hard threshold whose
  Python 0..100 range collapsed onto 0..10 in practice and chopped
  signal at the close transition. NS-2 / NS-1X-style THRESHOLD /
  DECAY / DAMP gives users a smoothed close ramp and a controllable
  closed-gain floor while staying cheap on the FPGA (one envelope
  register feedback + one smoothed-gain register feedback + one
  saturating multiply, same shape as the legacy gate).
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** RNNoise / FFT / spectral subtraction. Way too heavy for the
    PYNQ-Z2 PL budget; the suppressor is purely a smoothed time-domain
    gate.
  - **No** copying of source code from BOSS units, JS-Rocks NS-style
    blocks, or `noise-suppression-for-voice` / `libspecbleach` /
    similar GPL projects. Algorithmic shape (envelope follower,
    threshold compare, smoothed gain, damp closed-gain floor) is the
    only thing taken from the references.
- **Threshold scale change.** Python `noise_gate_threshold` is now on a
  one-tenth scale: byte = `round(threshold * 255 / 1000)`, so the new
  100 maps to the legacy 10 byte. `set_guitar_effects(noise_gate_threshold=...)`
  uses the same scaling and mirrors the byte to both the legacy
  `gate_control.ctrlB` slot (dead in the new bitstream, kept for
  backward compatibility) and the new `noise_suppressor_control.ctrlA`.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing the noise stage, edit the `ns*` block in
    `LowPassFir.hs`. Do **not** revive the legacy `gateGainNext` /
    `gateFrame` registers in the active pipeline.
  - `block_design.tcl` carries the new GPIO; any further GPIO change
    must keep `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` and its address `0x43CC0000`
    intact so overlays match.
  - Reserved knobs (mode byte, attack, hold, NS-2 vs NS-1X switch)
    should land on `noise_suppressor_control.ctrlD` rather than
    grabbing more bytes from existing GPIOs.

## D12 — GPIO design is fixed; effect refactors do not move bytes

- **Decision.** Once a GPIO has been deployed (name, address, and the
  meaning of `ctrlA` / `ctrlB` / `ctrlC` / `ctrlD`), refactors must
  not move it. Adding a new effect should land on a `reserved` byte
  / bit already documented in `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`. Adding a new
  `axi_gpio_*` IP is a last resort and requires explicit user
  approval (D2 still applies).
- **Why.** Multiple deployed bitstreams already carry this address
  map. Renaming or shuffling bytes risks silently breaking older
  bitstreams in the field (cf. `axi_gpio_delay`, which is named for
  a delay but drives the RAT — and cannot be renamed without a
  block-design change). Locking the layout also keeps Python /
  Clash / notebook / tests in lock-step.
- **How to apply.**
  - When you reach `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`, treat the table as a
    contract; never edit a row's address or its `ctrlA`-`ctrlD`
    semantics in the same change as a refactor.
  - If a refactor "wants" to rename a GPIO, propose a follow-up
    change instead and flag it for user approval.
  - The shipped exception is `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` at
    `0x43CC0000` (D11). Any future exception goes through the same
    gate.

## D13 — C++ DSP prototypes were removed from the active tree

- **Decision.** The earlier `src/effects/*.cpp` files
  (`RatStyleDistortion`, `SimpleAmpSimulator`, `CabIRSimulator`)
  were removed, along with their CPU-side tests
  (`tests/test_rat_style_distortion.cpp`,
  `tests/test_amp_cab_simulators.cpp`). The single source of truth
  for DSP behaviour on the live build is
  `hw/ip/clash/src/LowPassFir.hs`.
- **Why.** The C++ files were only reference implementations and
  never ran on the PYNQ-Z2 audio path. Their continued presence in
  the tree invited the "implement in C++ then port" pattern, which
  is not how this project ships effects — every effect is built
  directly in Clash for fixed-point + pipelined synthesis. Keeping
  the prototypes also confused agents and humans into believing
  `make tests` validated the FPGA path, which it never did.
- **How to apply.**
  - New effects start at the Python / UI / Clash layer; do not
    introduce a new C++ prototype.
  - Algorithm shape from GPL projects (guitarix, BYOD, etc.) is
    fair to reference (D7); their source is not.
  - `make tests` now runs Python tests only. `make cpp_tests` /
    `make test_cpp` are deprecated targets that print a notice
    instead of running anything.

## D14 — Compressor lives on its own AXI GPIO

- **Decision.** A dedicated `axi_gpio_compressor` IP at `0x43CD0000`
  carries THRESHOLD / RATIO / RESPONSE / enable+MAKEUP for a stereo-
  linked feed-forward peak compressor. The Clash side adds a new
  `compressor_control` port and a `compLevelPipe -> compEnv ->
  compGain -> compApplyPipe -> compMakeupPipe` block between the
  noise suppressor and the overdrive. Enable lives **inside this
  GPIO** (`ctrlD` bit 7), not on `gate_control.ctrlA`.
- **Why.**
  - The compressor needed five distinct knobs (threshold / ratio /
    response / makeup / enable). Stuffing them onto an existing
    `reserved` byte / bit was not possible:
    `axi_gpio_distortion.ctrlD[3..5,7]` is held for the reserved
    distortion pedals (`DECISIONS.md` D9),
    `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor.ctrlD` is held for NS-2 vs NS-1X
    mode / attack / hold (D11), `axi_gpio_eq.ctrlD` is held for a
    future EQ-section knob. Repurposing any of those would violate
    `DECISIONS.md` D12.
  - `gate_control.ctrlA` is the master flag byte and every bit is
    already owned by an existing effect's enable. Adding a new
    flag bit there would touch the meaning of an `active` byte,
    which D12 forbids.
  - The compressor benefits from being able to flip its own enable
    without read-modify-write on a shared flag byte; keeping the
    enable inside its own GPIO makes the section fully self-
    contained.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from the references studied for
    parameter naming and design philosophy: harveyf2801/AudioFX-
    Compressor, bdejong/musicdsp simple compressor, DanielRudrich/
    SimpleCompressor, chipaudette/OpenAudio_ArduinoLibrary,
    p-hlp/SMPLComp (GPL-3.0), Ashymad/bancom (GPL-3.0). Algorithmic
    structure (feed-forward peak detect, stereo link, gain
    reduction computer, envelope follower, makeup) is the only
    thing taken (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** lookahead, knee, multiband, sidechain input, or
    dB/log-domain math. The first compressor build is intentionally
    a 1-GPIO, light-weight ggitar-friendly section.
  - **No** C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Implementation went Python API + UI reservation -> Clash
    stage -> new GPIO directly.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing the compressor stage, edit the `comp*` block in
    `LowPassFir.hs`. Do not move or rename the block;
    `axi_gpio_compressor` and the `compressor_control` port are
    pinned by `block_design.tcl` and the deployed `.hwh`.
  - Reserved knobs (sidechain HPF, knee, mix, lookahead, attack and
    release as separate parameters) should land on a new GPIO via
    a new ADR rather than steal bytes from existing GPIOs.
  - The Python `set_compressor_settings(...)` API and the byte
    encoding in `control_maps.compressor_word` /
    `control_maps.makeup_to_u7` are the source of truth; keep
    notebook and tests in lock-step.

## D15 — Chain presets are Python/UI only, never new GPIO

- **Decision.** Practical pedalboard voicings ship as named entries in
  `effect_presets.CHAIN_PRESETS` and are applied via the Python
  facade (`AudioLabOverlay.apply_chain_preset`). They orchestrate the
  existing per-section setters and `set_guitar_effects`; they do
  **not** introduce new AXI GPIOs, new Clash stages, or new bitstream
  artefacts.
- **Why.** The chain-preset work is a usability layer on top of an
  already-deployed bitstream. Adding a new GPIO would force a full
  Vivado / Clash rebuild, a timing review, and a new bit/hwh deploy
  for what is essentially a curated lookup table. Keeping presets in
  Python also makes them easy to edit, snapshot-test, and iterate on
  without touching hardware.
- **Safety guarantees in the preset table.**
  - Compressor `makeup` is held to the 45..60 band (~unity to ~1.25x)
    in every preset, so flipping presets cannot produce a sudden
    volume jump that blows the rest of the chain.
  - Distortion `level` is capped at 35 in every preset.
  - The `Safe Bypass` preset has every section's `enabled=False` and
    `reverb.mix=0`. Tests enforce both.
- **How to apply.**
  - When adding a new preset, append it to `CHAIN_PRESETS` with one
    entry per section (`compressor` / `noise_suppressor` /
    `overdrive` / `distortion` / `amp` / `cab` / `eq` / `reverb`).
    The notebook picks it up automatically through
    `get_chain_preset_names()`.
  - Keep makeup in 45..60 and distortion `level` <= 35 unless you
    have a specific reason and update the safety tests in lock-step.
  - Do not introduce a new GPIO or a new Clash stage from this layer
    -- if a preset wants behaviour the FPGA does not currently
    expose, file it as a separate ADR (D11 / D14 style) instead.

## D10 — `GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb` is the user-facing entry point

- **Decision.** A new two-cell notebook,
  `audio_lab_pynq/notebooks/GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb`, is the
  primary single-screen UI for the live chain. It exists alongside
  the existing `GuitarEffectSwitcher.ipynb` and
  `DistortionModelsDebug.ipynb`; none of them is being deprecated.
- **Why.** The existing switcher and debug notebooks have specific
  jobs (per-effect tweak / per-pedal walkthrough). The one-cell
  notebook is what a player should open: Apply / Safe Bypass /
  Refresh + four presets, with the distortion pedalboard as a
  first-class UI section.
- **How to apply.** Notebook-only edits land here; no
  bitstream rebuild needed. Reserved pedals stay selectable so the
  UI does not change shape when those Clash stages land later.
