# Design decisions (ADR-style)

Each entry is a decision that earlier work made and that future work
should not silently revisit. New decisions go at the bottom; old ones do
not get removed even when superseded — they get updated.

---

## D1 — ADAU1761 ADC HPF is enabled by default

- **Decision.** `config_codec()` writes `R19_ADC_CONTROL = 0x03`, then
  uses RMW via `enable_adc_hpf()` to set R19[5], so the post-init value
  is `0x23`. A 300 ms settle is included before the DAC is enabled.
- **Why.** With the HPF off, capture-with-input-shorted showed a
  significant DC offset and elevated RMS. Toggling R19[5] removed the
  offset and dropped RMS dramatically, so the user requested it be the
  permanent default.
- **Important caveats.**
  - This is a ~2 Hz DC blocker, **not** a 20–40 Hz guitar low-cut.
    Treat it as an offset remover, nothing more.
  - The IIR has τ ≈ 80 ms at 48 kHz. After any toggle, allow ~3–4 τ
    (≈ 300 ms) before measurement, and discard the first ~50 ms of any
    capture (handled in `diagnostic_capture` with `settling_ms` and
    `discard_initial_frames`).
- **How to apply.** Never remove the `enable_adc_hpf()` call from
  `config_codec()`. If a future test needs it off, do it explicitly and
  restore the default.

## D2 — `block_design.tcl` is off-limits by default

- **Decision.** New control bits and new effect stages reuse the spare
  bytes of the existing `axi_gpio_*` IPs. Adding or reconfiguring an
  AXI GPIO requires a `block_design.tcl` change and explicit user
  approval.
- **Why.** The existing block design has timing margin already eaten
  (see `TIMING_AND_FPGA_NOTES.md`). Touching the block design risks
  regenerating addresses, breaking the C++/Python address map, and
  destabilising the build.
- **How to apply.** When asked for new control bits, look for a spare
  byte first (`GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`). Only escalate to a block-design
  change when the user agrees in writing.

## D3 — Deploys go through `scripts/deploy_to_pynq.sh`

- **Decision.** Any change that ships to the PYNQ-Z2 goes through that
  script, which uses SSH key auth and never stores a password.
- **Why.** Earlier ad-hoc `scp` flows risked interactive password
  prompts that the agent could not satisfy and risked desyncing the
  package install vs the bitstream.
- **How to apply.** Use the script. Override host or paths via env
  vars (`PYNQ_HOST`, `PYNQ_USER`, `PYNQ_REPO_DIR`, `PYNQ_NB_DIR`,
  `SSH_KEY`).

## D4 — PYNQ overlay work needs root

- **Decision.** Anything that touches `Overlay()`, DMA, `pynq.allocate`
  or the `/dev/uio*` devices runs as `sudo`. Use
  `sudo env PYTHONPATH=/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ python3 …`.
- **Why.** The PYNQ Linux image gates UIO and contiguous-memory
  allocation behind root. Trying to use the overlay as `xilinx`
  fails with surprising error messages that point in the wrong
  direction.

## D5 — Live package source is `/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ/`

- **Decision.** Always put `/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ` first on
  `PYTHONPATH` for board-side runs.
- **Why.** The PYNQ image carries an older copy of `audio_lab_pynq`
  under `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/`. Without the
  PYTHONPATH override the test may run the wrong code and silently
  succeed, hiding regressions.

## D6 — The `model_select` 8-way mux distortion plan is dead

- **Decision.** Selectable distortion models are implemented as
  independent pedal stages (each with its own enable bit), not as a
  numeric `model_select` driving a giant case statement. This
  decision shipped in commit `baa97ff`.
- **Why.** The `model_select` build pushed Vivado WNS from -7.722 ns
  to -15.067 ns. The combinational depth of the per-stage 8-way case
  was the cause; the design did not deploy safely in that shape. The
  pedal-mask replacement restored WNS to -7.801 ns and was deployed.
- **How to apply.** Read `DISTORTION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`. Do not add
  new `case modelSelect of …` blocks to `LowPassFir.hs`. Pedal
  enables live in `distortion_control.ctrlD`; the section master
  stays at `gate_control.ctrlA[2]`.

## D7 — Reference repositories are read-only inspiration

- **Decision.** Algorithmic structure of guitarix, BYOD, JS-Rocks,
  PunkMuff, ToobAmp, dm-Rat, etc. may be studied. Their **source
  code is not copied** into this repository.
- **Why.** Several of those projects are GPL-licensed. This
  repository is WTFPL. Pasting GPL code (whole or near-verbatim) is
  not compatible. Beyond the licence question, hand-rolling the Clash
  forces us to keep the implementation small enough to fit the FPGA.
- **How to apply.** No `git submodule add`, no `git clone` into the
  tree. If a reference is needed for a session, clone it into
  `/tmp` or another scratch path the repo never sees.

## D8 — `rat` pedal maps onto the existing RAT stage

- **Decision.** The `rat` entry in the new pedal-mask API does not
  add a new Clash stage. Instead, when bit 2 of
  `distortion_control.ctrlD` is set, the Python facade
  (`_apply_distortion_state_to_words`) also forces `gate_control`
  bit 4 high, engaging the existing RAT block (`ratHighpassFrame`
  through `ratMixFrame`).
- **Why.** The existing RAT implementation is a complete, tested,
  parameter-rich voicing. Re-implementing it inside the new
  pedal-mask pipeline would have duplicated logic, eaten timing,
  and produced a slightly different sound for no gain.
- **How to apply.** Do not add a `ratStyle*Frame` chain. If the
  user wants a different RAT-style flavour, expose it as a new
  pedal bit (e.g. an unused reserved slot) rather than rewriting
  the existing one.

## D9 — `ds1` / `big_muff` / `fuzz_face` reservation lifted; bits 3-5 are now implemented

- **Decision (original).** Bits 3, 4, 5 of `distortion_control.ctrlD`
  were reserved for `ds1`, `big_muff`, and `fuzz_face` while the
  Python API and notebook UI already accepted the names; the FPGA
  passed audio through bit-exact when only those bits were set.
- **Decision (current, `feature/add-reserved-distortion-pedals`).**
  All three reserved pedals now have working Clash stages in the
  deployed bitstream:
  - `ds1` (bit 3): 5 register stages — HPF -> mul -> asym soft clip
    with low knees -> post LPF -> level+safety. Voicing aim is
    BOSS DS-1 style edgy crunch.
  - `big_muff` (bit 4): 5 register stages — pre-gain -> softClipK
    medium knee -> softClipK tighter knee with ~0.75x gain ->
    tone LPF -> level+safety. Voicing aim is Big Muff Pi style
    cascaded soft clip with a darker top end.
  - `fuzz_face` (bit 5): 4 register stages — pre-gain -> strong
    asymSoftClip -> tone LPF -> level+safety. Voicing aim is
    Fuzz Face style raw asymmetric breakup; the TONE knob doubles
    as a "round vs. bright" axis since real Fuzz Faces typically
    lack a tone control.
  Each block is gated by its own enable predicate (`ds1On` /
  `bigMuffOn` / `fuzzFaceOn`); when the bit is clear every stage is
  bit-exact bypass. The new sections slot into `fxPipeline` after
  `metalLevelPipe`, with `distortionPedalsPipe = fuzzFaceLevelPipe`.
- **Why the original reservation was kept.** Locking the bit
  positions early kept the GPIO layout and Python API stable across
  the staged rollout, so the implementation work was a pure code
  addition: no GPIO shuffle, no Python API churn, no notebook
  rewrite of the per-pedal pipeline.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from BOSS DS-1 schematics-exact
    coefficient tables, the public Big Muff Pi schematic, or
    Dallas Arbiter / Dunlop Fuzz Face circuit transcriptions, nor
    from any GPL DSP project (guitarix, BYOD, JS-Rocks,
    PunkMuff, dm-Rat, ToobAmp, etc.). Algorithmic shape (HPF ->
    drive -> clip -> post LPF -> level, soft / hard / asym clip
    helper choice, cascaded soft clip for Muff-style fuzz, low-knee
    asym clip for fuzz-face-style breakup) is the only thing taken
    (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** new GPIO. Bit 7 of the pedal mask remains the only
    reserved slot, held for a future 8th pedal.
  - **No** revival of the 8-way `model_select` mux structure; each
    pedal stays in its own register-staged block (`DECISIONS.md`
    D6 / `TIMING_AND_FPGA_NOTES.md`).
  - **No** new C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Implementation went Python API + UI relabel -> Clash
    stages directly.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing a `ds1` / `big_muff` / `fuzz_face` voicing, edit
    the matching `ds1*Frame` / `bigMuff*Frame` / `fuzzFace*Frame`
    block in `LowPassFir.hs`. Do not introduce a wider case over
    pedal selectors; each block is independently enabled.
  - The Python API surface (`set_distortion_pedal`,
    `set_distortion_pedals`, `set_distortion_settings(pedal=...)`)
    is unchanged; the only public change is that
    `DISTORTION_PEDALS_IMPLEMENTED` now lists every pedal name.
  - Notebook reserved-pedal warning banners are dropped. Keep the
    legacy `*_reserved` PEDAL_LABEL_TO_API aliases pointing at the
    implemented pedals so older live notebook sessions still work.

## D11 — Noise suppressor lives on its own AXI GPIO; legacy gate is replaced

- **Decision.** A dedicated `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` IP at
  `0x43CC0000` carries THRESHOLD / DECAY / DAMP / mode for a BOSS
  NS-2 / NS-1X-style noise suppressor. The Clash side replaces the
  legacy hard noise gate stages (`gateLevelPipe -> gateEnv -> gateOpen
  -> gateGain -> gatePipe`) with new envelope + smoothed-gain stages
  (`nsLevelPipe -> nsEnv -> nsGain -> nsPipe`). Enable still rides on
  `gate_control` bit 0 (the legacy `noise_gate_on` flag).
- **Why.** The legacy noise gate exposed a single hard threshold whose
  Python 0..100 range collapsed onto 0..10 in practice and chopped
  signal at the close transition. NS-2 / NS-1X-style THRESHOLD /
  DECAY / DAMP gives users a smoothed close ramp and a controllable
  closed-gain floor while staying cheap on the FPGA (one envelope
  register feedback + one smoothed-gain register feedback + one
  saturating multiply, same shape as the legacy gate).
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** RNNoise / FFT / spectral subtraction. Way too heavy for the
    PYNQ-Z2 PL budget; the suppressor is purely a smoothed time-domain
    gate.
  - **No** copying of source code from BOSS units, JS-Rocks NS-style
    blocks, or `noise-suppression-for-voice` / `libspecbleach` /
    similar GPL projects. Algorithmic shape (envelope follower,
    threshold compare, smoothed gain, damp closed-gain floor) is the
    only thing taken from the references.
- **Threshold scale change.** Python `noise_gate_threshold` is now on a
  one-tenth scale: byte = `round(threshold * 255 / 1000)`, so the new
  100 maps to the legacy 10 byte. `set_guitar_effects(noise_gate_threshold=...)`
  uses the same scaling and mirrors the byte to both the legacy
  `gate_control.ctrlB` slot (dead in the new bitstream, kept for
  backward compatibility) and the new `noise_suppressor_control.ctrlA`.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing the noise stage, edit the `ns*` block in
    `LowPassFir.hs`. Do **not** revive the legacy `gateGainNext` /
    `gateFrame` registers in the active pipeline.
  - `block_design.tcl` carries the new GPIO; any further GPIO change
    must keep `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` and its address `0x43CC0000`
    intact so overlays match.
  - Reserved knobs (mode byte, attack, hold, NS-2 vs NS-1X switch)
    should land on `noise_suppressor_control.ctrlD` rather than
    grabbing more bytes from existing GPIOs.

## D12 — GPIO design is fixed; effect refactors do not move bytes

- **Decision.** Once a GPIO has been deployed (name, address, and the
  meaning of `ctrlA` / `ctrlB` / `ctrlC` / `ctrlD`), refactors must
  not move it. Adding a new effect should land on a `reserved` byte
  / bit already documented in `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`. Adding a new
  `axi_gpio_*` IP is a last resort and requires explicit user
  approval (D2 still applies).
- **Why.** Multiple deployed bitstreams already carry this address
  map. Renaming or shuffling bytes risks silently breaking older
  bitstreams in the field (cf. `axi_gpio_delay`, which is named for
  a delay but drives the RAT — and cannot be renamed without a
  block-design change). Locking the layout also keeps Python /
  Clash / notebook / tests in lock-step.
- **How to apply.**
  - When you reach `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`, treat the table as a
    contract; never edit a row's address or its `ctrlA`-`ctrlD`
    semantics in the same change as a refactor.
  - If a refactor "wants" to rename a GPIO, propose a follow-up
    change instead and flag it for user approval.
  - The shipped exception is `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor` at
    `0x43CC0000` (D11). Any future exception goes through the same
    gate.

## D13 — C++ DSP prototypes were removed from the active tree

- **Decision.** The earlier `src/effects/*.cpp` files
  (`RatStyleDistortion`, `SimpleAmpSimulator`, `CabIRSimulator`)
  were removed, along with their CPU-side tests
  (`tests/test_rat_style_distortion.cpp`,
  `tests/test_amp_cab_simulators.cpp`). The single source of truth
  for DSP behaviour on the live build is
  `hw/ip/clash/src/LowPassFir.hs`.
- **Why.** The C++ files were only reference implementations and
  never ran on the PYNQ-Z2 audio path. Their continued presence in
  the tree invited the "implement in C++ then port" pattern, which
  is not how this project ships effects — every effect is built
  directly in Clash for fixed-point + pipelined synthesis. Keeping
  the prototypes also confused agents and humans into believing
  `make tests` validated the FPGA path, which it never did.
- **How to apply.**
  - New effects start at the Python / UI / Clash layer; do not
    introduce a new C++ prototype.
  - Algorithm shape from GPL projects (guitarix, BYOD, etc.) is
    fair to reference (D7); their source is not.
  - `make tests` now runs Python tests only. `make cpp_tests` /
    `make test_cpp` are deprecated targets that print a notice
    instead of running anything.

## D14 — Compressor lives on its own AXI GPIO

- **Decision.** A dedicated `axi_gpio_compressor` IP at `0x43CD0000`
  carries THRESHOLD / RATIO / RESPONSE / enable+MAKEUP for a stereo-
  linked feed-forward peak compressor. The Clash side adds a new
  `compressor_control` port and a `compLevelPipe -> compEnv ->
  compGain -> compApplyPipe -> compMakeupPipe` block between the
  noise suppressor and the overdrive. Enable lives **inside this
  GPIO** (`ctrlD` bit 7), not on `gate_control.ctrlA`.
- **Why.**
  - The compressor needed five distinct knobs (threshold / ratio /
    response / makeup / enable). Stuffing them onto an existing
    `reserved` byte / bit was not possible:
    `axi_gpio_distortion.ctrlD[3..5,7]` is held for the reserved
    distortion pedals (`DECISIONS.md` D9),
    `axi_gpio_noise_suppressor.ctrlD` is held for NS-2 vs NS-1X
    mode / attack / hold (D11), `axi_gpio_eq.ctrlD` is held for a
    future EQ-section knob. Repurposing any of those would violate
    `DECISIONS.md` D12.
  - `gate_control.ctrlA` is the master flag byte and every bit is
    already owned by an existing effect's enable. Adding a new
    flag bit there would touch the meaning of an `active` byte,
    which D12 forbids.
  - The compressor benefits from being able to flip its own enable
    without read-modify-write on a shared flag byte; keeping the
    enable inside its own GPIO makes the section fully self-
    contained.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from the references studied for
    parameter naming and design philosophy: harveyf2801/AudioFX-
    Compressor, bdejong/musicdsp simple compressor, DanielRudrich/
    SimpleCompressor, chipaudette/OpenAudio_ArduinoLibrary,
    p-hlp/SMPLComp (GPL-3.0), Ashymad/bancom (GPL-3.0). Algorithmic
    structure (feed-forward peak detect, stereo link, gain
    reduction computer, envelope follower, makeup) is the only
    thing taken (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** lookahead, knee, multiband, sidechain input, or
    dB/log-domain math. The first compressor build is intentionally
    a 1-GPIO, light-weight ggitar-friendly section.
  - **No** C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Implementation went Python API + UI reservation -> Clash
    stage -> new GPIO directly.
- **How to apply.**
  - When changing the compressor stage, edit the `comp*` block in
    `LowPassFir.hs`. Do not move or rename the block;
    `axi_gpio_compressor` and the `compressor_control` port are
    pinned by `block_design.tcl` and the deployed `.hwh`.
  - Reserved knobs (sidechain HPF, knee, mix, lookahead, attack and
    release as separate parameters) should land on a new GPIO via
    a new ADR rather than steal bytes from existing GPIOs.
  - The Python `set_compressor_settings(...)` API and the byte
    encoding in `control_maps.compressor_word` /
    `control_maps.makeup_to_u7` are the source of truth; keep
    notebook and tests in lock-step.

## D15 — Chain presets are Python/UI only, never new GPIO

- **Decision.** Practical pedalboard voicings ship as named entries in
  `effect_presets.CHAIN_PRESETS` and are applied via the Python
  facade (`AudioLabOverlay.apply_chain_preset`). They orchestrate the
  existing per-section setters and `set_guitar_effects`; they do
  **not** introduce new AXI GPIOs, new Clash stages, or new bitstream
  artefacts.
- **Why.** The chain-preset work is a usability layer on top of an
  already-deployed bitstream. Adding a new GPIO would force a full
  Vivado / Clash rebuild, a timing review, and a new bit/hwh deploy
  for what is essentially a curated lookup table. Keeping presets in
  Python also makes them easy to edit, snapshot-test, and iterate on
  without touching hardware.
- **Safety guarantees in the preset table.**
  - Compressor `makeup` is held to the 45..60 band (~unity to ~1.25x)
    in every preset, so flipping presets cannot produce a sudden
    volume jump that blows the rest of the chain.
  - Distortion `level` is capped at 35 in every preset.
  - The `Safe Bypass` preset has every section's `enabled=False` and
    `reverb.mix=0`. Tests enforce both.
- **How to apply.**
  - When adding a new preset, append it to `CHAIN_PRESETS` with one
    entry per section (`compressor` / `noise_suppressor` /
    `overdrive` / `distortion` / `amp` / `cab` / `eq` / `reverb`).
    The notebook picks it up automatically through
    `get_chain_preset_names()`.
  - Keep makeup in 45..60 and distortion `level` <= 35 unless you
    have a specific reason and update the safety tests in lock-step.
  - Do not introduce a new GPIO or a new Clash stage from this layer
    -- if a preset wants behaviour the FPGA does not currently
    expose, file it as a separate ADR (D11 / D14 style) instead.

## D16 — Real-pedal voicing pass tunes existing stages, never adds new ones

- **Decision.** Effect voicings can be moved closer to recognised
  real-pedal voicings (TS / RAT / MT-2 / Dyna Comp / NS-2 / cab IR /
  pedal reverb) by editing the constants and clip-helper choice
  inside the existing register stages of `LowPassFir.hs`. A voicing
  pass must **not** add a new GPIO, a new `topEntity` port, a new
  Clash register stage, or a new effect block. Reserved bytes / bits
  documented in `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md` stay reserved.
- **Why.**
  - Adding a GPIO or a new stage forces a `block_design.tcl` change
    (forbidden by D2 without explicit user approval) and re-opens
    timing risk that the pedal-mask refactor (D6 / `model_select`
    post-mortem) already paid down.
  - Existing chain presets and the public Python API are
    byte-for-byte compatible across the voicing pass: the bytes the
    notebook writes to each GPIO are unchanged, only the meaning
    given to those bytes by the live Clash bitstream shifts. Users
    keep the same control range and the same slider numbers.
  - The reference style for each effect is documented in
    `REAL_PEDAL_VOICING_TARGETS.md` so future passes have a clear
    "did the change land in the intended direction?" check.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of source code from Tube Screamer / RAT / MT-2 /
    Dyna Comp / NS-2 / NS-1X schematics-exact coefficient tables, or
    GPL DSP projects. Algorithmic shape (HPF -> drive -> clip ->
    post LPF -> level, soft / hard / asym clip choice, hysteresis
    around a threshold, IR coefficient damping) is the only thing
    taken (`DECISIONS.md` D7).
  - **No** new C++ DSP prototype as a stepping stone (`DECISIONS.md`
    D13). Voicing changes go directly into Clash.
  - **No** new lookahead, no new multi-band processing, no new
    spectral methods. The PL budget is what it is.
- **How to apply.**
  - Read `REAL_PEDAL_VOICING_TARGETS.md` before changing the voicing
    of an effect; record the new target / current / gap / plan rows
    in the same file.
  - Constant changes inside an existing stage are fine. Replacing
    `softClip` with `softClipK` / `asymSoftClip` / `hardClip` is
    fine. Changing a `mulU8` to a different gain expression is fine.
  - Adding a new register-staged block, a new `Frame` field, or a
    new `topEntity` port is **not** a voicing change; that is a new
    effect (case 4 in `EFFECT_ADDING_GUIDE.md`).
  - After any voicing pass that touches `LowPassFir.hs`: run
    `clash --vhdl`, repackage the IP via Vivado `create_ip.tcl`,
    rebuild bit/hwh, check timing, deploy, smoke-test all chain
    presets on the board.
  - The first voicing pass landed on the `feature/real-pedal-voicing-
    pass` branch and rebuilt the deployed bitstream from
    WNS = -7.516 ns to WNS = -6.405 ns (improved by 1.111 ns); hold
    stayed clean.

## D10 — `GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb` is the user-facing entry point

- **Decision.** A new two-cell notebook,
  `audio_lab_pynq/notebooks/GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb`, is the
  primary single-screen UI for the live chain. It exists alongside
  the existing `GuitarEffectSwitcher.ipynb` and
  `DistortionModelsDebug.ipynb`; none of them is being deprecated.
- **Why.** The existing switcher and debug notebooks have specific
  jobs (per-effect tweak / per-pedal walkthrough). The one-cell
  notebook is what a player should open: Apply / Safe Bypass /
  Refresh + four presets, with the distortion pedalboard as a
  first-class UI section.
- **How to apply.** Notebook-only edits land here; no
  bitstream rebuild needed. Reserved pedals stay selectable so the
  UI does not change shape when those Clash stages land later.

## D17 — Audio-analysis-driven voicing fixes tune existing stages only

- **Decision.** Recording-analysis-driven voicing fixes are implemented by
  retuning constants, coefficient tables, and clip-helper knees inside
  existing `LowPassFir.hs` stages. They must not add a new GPIO, a new
  `topEntity` port, a new `block_design.tcl` change, or a new selector
  topology.
- **Why.**
  - The recording analysis in `AUDIO_RECORDING_ANALYSIS.md` showed four
    actionable gaps: AmpSim had too much >5 kHz fizz, Cabinet roll-off
    was correct but still too weak for high-gain pedals, Overdrive was
    nearly indistinguishable from Bypass, and Compressor crest factor was
    almost unchanged.
  - The existing controls already expose the needed musical axes:
    Overdrive drive/tone/level, Compressor threshold/ratio/response/makeup,
    Amp input gain / master / presence / resonance / BMT / character, and
    Cab mix / level / model / air. Reusing them preserves the Python API
    and Notebook UI.
  - The design already runs with negative setup slack. A long cabinet IR,
    a new amp model selector, extra dB/log-domain processing, or a new
    GPIO would reopen timing and integration risk for a voicing problem.
- **What changed in the analysis pass.**
  - Amp: input gain ceiling trimmed again, post-clip pre-LPF darkened,
    treble and presence contribution capped harder, resonance/presence /
    power/master safety `softClipK` knees moved earlier.
  - Cab: the existing 4-tap coefficient table was rebuilt again with
    stronger model separation. Model 0 remains a lighter 1x12 open-back
    style, model 1 a balanced 2x12 combo style, and model 2 the darkest
    4x12 closed-back style for DS-1 / Metal / Big Muff / Fuzz.
  - Overdrive: drive mapping increased moderately, asymmetric clip knees
    lowered, and level output wrapped in a lower `softClipK` safety.
  - Compressor: effective threshold lowered, soft knee widened, reduction
    slope increased modestly, and response smoothing made more reactive.
  - Chain preset retune was numeric only: DS-1 Crunch now leans on Cab
    model 2 with capped air. Safe Bypass and safety caps are unchanged.
  - The deployed build kept `cabLevelMixFrame` on the existing
    timing-friendly `softClip`; a lower `softClipK 3_400_000` trial
    reached WNS = -9.891 ns and was not deployed.
  - Final deployed timing was WNS = -8.731 ns, TNS = -13665.555 ns,
    WHS = +0.051 ns, THS = 0.000 ns.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** commercial amp circuit constants, commercial cabinet IRs,
    pedal circuit coefficient tables, or schematic-derived coefficients
    were copied.
  - **No** GPL DSP code was moved into this WTFPL project.
  - **No** long FIR / convolution IR loader, dB/log math, lookahead,
    multiband compressor, amp model selector, new AXI GPIO, or revived
    C++ DSP prototype was added.
- **How to apply.**
  - Future voicing work should follow the loop: record -> analyze ->
    make the smallest existing-stage DSP change -> rebuild -> redeploy
    -> re-record / listen.
  - Keep Amp/Cab changes in `amp*Frame`, `ampAsymClip`, `cabCoeff`,
    `cabProductsFrame`, `cabIrFrame`, and `cabLevelMixFrame` unless the
    user explicitly approves a new topology.
  - Keep Overdrive changes in `overdriveDriveMultiplyFrame`,
    `overdriveDriveBoostFrame`, `overdriveDriveClipFrame`,
    `overdriveToneFrame` / tone blend, and `overdriveLevelFrame`.
  - Keep Compressor changes in `compThresholdSample`, `compTargetGain`,
    `compGainNext`, `compMakeupFrame`, and the existing compressor block.
  - Preserve every GPIO name, address, and `ctrlA` / `ctrlB` / `ctrlC` /
    `ctrlD` meaning from `GPIO_CONTROL_MAP.md`.
  - After any `LowPassFir.hs` voicing change: regenerate VHDL, repackage
    IP, rebuild bit/hwh, check timing, deploy only if WNS remains in the
    accepted band and WHS/THS stay clean, then smoke-test chain presets.


## D18 — Amp Simulator named models reuse `amp_character`, never new GPIO

- **Decision.** The Amp Simulator section ships four named voicings —
  `jc_clean` / `clean_combo` / `british_crunch` / `high_gain_stack` —
  as a convenience layer on top of the existing `amp_character`
  knob. The Python side adds an `AMP_MODELS` table, `set_amp_model`,
  `get_amp_model_names`, and `amp_model_to_character` helpers; the
  Clash side quantises the same byte into a two-bit `ampModelSel`
  index that adds a tiny per-band darken to the post-clip pre-LPF.
  The numeric `amp_character` knob still works directly.
- **Why.**
  - Listening to the audio-analysis recordings showed that high-gain
    pedals into the amp produced a second top-end brightening at the
    same `amp_character` value that worked well for clean settings.
    Splitting the character byte into 4 bands gives each named voicing
    a slightly different LPF target without making `amp_character`
    discontinuous and without breaking the chain-preset / safe-bypass
    logic that already drives the byte directly.
  - Adding a separate GPIO or `topEntity` port for an amp model
    selector would have been a `block_design.tcl` change (forbidden
    by D2 without explicit user approval) and would also have eaten
    timing on a build that is already running with negative setup
    slack. Reusing the existing byte avoids both.
  - The `model_select` post-mortem (D6) still applies. The new
    `ampModelSel` is consumed in **one** stage only and only
    biases a single alpha constant, not a wide mux over independent
    multipliers / clippers / filters.
- **Trade-offs not taken.**
  - **No** copying of commercial amp circuit constants, schematic-
    derived coefficients, or GPL DSP code (`DECISIONS.md` D7 / D11 /
    D14 / D17). The model names are inspirations only.
  - **No** new GPIO and **no** new `topEntity` port; the Frame shape
    is unchanged.
  - **No** model-specific switching of the asym clip knees, second-
    stage gain, presence cap, or resonance amount. Those stay
    continuously controlled by the existing `amp_character` /
    `amp_presence` / `amp_resonance` bytes; only the post-clip
    pre-LPF alpha is biased per band.
- **How to apply.**
  - Voicing tweaks to a specific amp model edit the matching band
    inside `ampPreLowpassFrame` (or extend `ampModelSel` to cover a
    second amp stage). Do not introduce a wide case over per-stage
    coefficient tables.
  - The Python `AMP_MODELS` mapping is the source of truth for the
    centre-of-band character values. Keep it in lock-step with the
    `ampModelSel` thresholds in `LowPassFir.hs` and the inline
    fallback inside `GuitarPedalboardOneCell.ipynb`.
  - The `amp_character` numeric API stays public; `set_amp_model` is
    a thin wrapper around `set_guitar_effects(amp_character=...)`.
    Tests in `tests/test_overlay_controls.py` lock the mapping
    anchors and the per-model byte distinctness.

## D20 — Amp Simulator fizz-control pass stays within existing Amp stage

- **Decision.** The May 8 Amp Simulator high-frequency fizz-control
  pass is an existing-stage Amp retune only. It targets the excessive
  high-frequency content generated by Amp Sim itself, especially the
  broad 8..16 kHz fizz heard on high-gain voicings, without changing
  the input -> bypass path, codec/I2S/hardware routing, noise floor,
  Cab Sim topology, or any non-Amp effect.
- **What changed.**
  - `ampPreLowpassFrame` keeps the existing one-pole post-clip
    smoothing and `ampModelSel`, but increases the per-model alpha
    darken from `0 / 2 / 8 / 16` to `0 / 4 / 12 / 24`. The clean
    model stays brightest; `high_gain_stack` rolls off most.
  - `ampTrebleGain` now accepts the character byte, lowers the base
    high-band return slightly, and applies a small model trim
    (`0 / 2 / 5 / 9`) so TREBLE=100 does not restore as much
    8..16 kHz energy.
  - `ampResPresenceProductsFrame` keeps presence on the existing
    `amp_presence` byte but subtracts a model-dependent trim
    (`0`, `presence>>5`, `presence>>4`, or `presence>>3`) so
    high-gain presence is capped harder than clean presence.
  - `ampPowerFrame` and `ampResPresenceMixFrame` move the safety
    `softClipK` knee from `3_500_000` to `3_400_000`.
- **Boundaries.**
  - **No** new GPIO, no `topEntity` port, no `Frame` field, no
    `block_design.tcl` change, and no new register stage.
  - **No** Delay implementation from `feature/bram-delay-500ms`; no
    `axi_gpio_delay_line`. Legacy `axi_gpio_delay` remains present.
  - **No** Compressor / Noise Suppressor / Overdrive / Distortion
    Pedalboard / Cab IR / EQ / Reverb retune in this pass.
  - **No** analysis tool, test signal generator, C++ DSP prototype,
    commercial amp circuit / IR / coefficient copy, or GPL code.
- **Build / deploy result.** Clash type check, VHDL generation, IP
  repackage, and Vivado bit/hwh rebuild completed successfully.
  Final routed timing was WNS = -8.022 ns, TNS = -13937.512 ns,
  WHS = +0.052 ns, THS = 0.000 ns, improving WNS by 0.709 ns vs the
  prior audio-analysis deployed baseline (-8.731 ns). Utilization
  after place: Slice LUTs 21809 (40.99%), Slice Registers 18675
  (17.55%), Block RAM Tile 7 (5.00%), DSPs 158 (71.82%).
- **PYNQ result.** Deployed to PYNQ-Z2 with
  `PYNQ_HOST=192.168.1.8 bash scripts/deploy_to_pynq.sh`. Smoke test
  confirmed `ADC HPF: True`, `R19 = 0x23`,
  `has delay_line gpio: False`, `has legacy axi_gpio_delay: True`,
  all four amp models, and the requested chain presets.
- **How to apply.** Future Amp fizz work should stay inside the
  existing `amp*Frame` stages unless the user explicitly approves a
  topology change. Reuse `ampModelSel` only for small per-band
  constant trims, not for a wide model-select mux over independent
  filters, clippers, or multipliers.

## D21 — LowPassFir split is behavior-preserving only

- **Decision.** The May 8 LowPassFir split refactor separates the
  Clash source into smaller `AudioLab.*` modules without changing DSP
  behavior. `LowPassFir.hs` remains the Vivado-visible top module and
  keeps the `topEntity` type, port names, port order, and external
  I/O unchanged.
- **What changed.**
  - Type aliases, `Frame`, `AxisOut`, and common memory definitions
    moved to `AudioLab.Types`.
  - Fixed-point and clipping helpers moved to `AudioLab.FixedPoint`.
  - `ctrlA` / `ctrlB` / `ctrlC` / `ctrlD`, flag helpers, and
    distortion-pedal enable helpers moved to `AudioLab.Control`.
  - AXIS pack/unpack and input/output packet helpers moved to
    `AudioLab.Axis`.
  - Existing effect stage functions moved into
    `AudioLab.Effects.NoiseSuppressor`, `Compressor`, `Overdrive`,
    `Distortion`, `Amp`, `Cab`, `Eq`, and `Reverb`.
  - `fxPipeline` and the unchanged register-stage wiring moved to
    `AudioLab.Pipeline`.
- **Boundaries.**
  - **No** DSP algorithm change, coefficient change, clip-knee change,
    fixed-point arithmetic change, bit-width change, register-stage
    order change, enable / disable behavior change, or bypass behavior
    change.
  - **No** mono conversion, 96 kHz work, PCM1808 / PCM5102 support,
    external ADC/DAC support, I2S interface change, or internal 32-bit
    conversion.
  - **No** `block_design.tcl` change, no new AXI GPIO, no GPIO address
    or `ctrlA`-`ctrlD` semantic change, no Python API change, no
    Notebook UI change, and no Chain Preset change.
  - **No** Delay implementation from `feature/bram-delay-500ms`; no
    `axi_gpio_delay_line`. Legacy `axi_gpio_delay` remains present.
  - **No** C++ DSP prototype revival, commercial source import, or GPL
    code import.
- **Build result.** Clash type check, VHDL generation, IP repackage,
  and Vivado bit/hwh rebuild completed locally. Final routed timing:
  WNS = -8.022 ns, TNS = -13937.512 ns, WHS = +0.052 ns,
  THS = 0.000 ns. This matches the previous deployed Amp Simulator
  fizz-control baseline (WNS delta 0.000 ns). Utilization after place:
  Slice LUTs 21809 (40.99%), Slice Registers 18675 (17.55%),
  Block RAM Tile 7 (5.00%), DSPs 158 (71.82%).
- **PYNQ result.** Deployed to PYNQ-Z2 with
  `PYNQ_HOST=192.168.1.9 bash scripts/deploy_to_pynq.sh`. Smoke test
  confirmed `ADC HPF: True`, `R19 = 0x23`,
  `has delay_line gpio: False`, `has legacy axi_gpio_delay: True`,
  all four amp models, and the requested chain presets.
- **How to apply.** Future DSP work should keep dependencies flowing
  from `LowPassFir` -> `AudioLab.Pipeline` -> `AudioLab.Effects.*` ->
  `AudioLab.Types` / `FixedPoint` / `Control` / `Axis`. Shared
  helpers belong in the common modules, not in an effect module that
  another effect imports.

## D22 — DSP pipeline uses mono internal processing while preserving stereo AXI I/O

- **Decision.** The May 9 internal mono DSP pass keeps the external
  AXI/I2S interface stereo-compatible while treating guitar audio as a
  Left-derived mono signal inside the DSP pipeline.
- **What changed.**
  - AXI input and output remain 48-bit stereo. `packChan` /
    `unpackChan`, `topEntity`, port names, port order, and external
    I/O are unchanged.
  - `AudioLab.Axis.makeInput` uses ADC Left as the mono source and
    explicitly discards Right to avoid unconnected-channel noise.
  - The physical `Frame` record keeps its L/R-shaped fields for module
    compatibility, but the active path uses mono helpers/state in
    `AudioLab.Types`, `AudioLab.Pipeline`, and `AudioLab.Effects.*`.
  - `AudioLab.Axis.pipeData` duplicates the final mono sample to
    output Left and Right.
  - AXI Stream metadata is not derived from sample data. `Frame.fLast`
    carries input TLAST to output TLAST, and `AudioLab.Pipeline` paces
    accepted DMA input frames so the fixed-latency DSP pipeline keeps
    one output frame per accepted input frame when S2MM ready briefly
    deasserts.
- **Boundaries.**
  - **No** DSP coefficient retune, clip-knee retune, byte mapping
    change, enable semantics change, Python API change, Notebook UI
    change, Chain Preset change, GPIO change, or `block_design.tcl`
    change.
  - **No** 96 kHz work, PCM1808 / PCM5102 support, external ADC/DAC
    support, I2S addition, internal 32-bit conversion, new GPIO, Delay
    line implementation, or `axi_gpio_delay_line`.
- **Build / deploy result.** Local Python tests, Notebook JSON checks,
  Clash type check / VHDL generation, IP repackage, and Vivado bit/hwh
  rebuild passed. Final routed timing: WNS = -8.155 ns,
  TNS = -6492.876 ns, WHS = +0.052 ns, THS = 0.000 ns. Versus the
  minimal mono build / `37ef4c7` baseline (WNS = -8.022 ns), WNS delta
  is -0.133 ns. Utilization after place: Slice LUTs 15473 (29.08%),
  Slice Registers 14914 (14.02%), Block RAM Tile 7 (5.00%), DSPs 83
  (37.73%).
- **PYNQ result.** Deployed to PYNQ-Z2 at `192.168.1.9` with
  `bash scripts/deploy_to_pynq.sh`. Smoke test confirmed
  `ADC HPF: True`, `R19 = 0x23`, no `axi_gpio_delay_line`, legacy
  `axi_gpio_delay` present, and the requested chain presets.
- **DMA / L-R result.** After PYNQ reboot, one overlay load and one
  composite DMA packet covered Case A (Left nonzero / Right different),
  Case B (Left zero / Right large), and Case C (Right inverted noise).
  All cases completed without DMA timeout. Send and recv DMASR both
  ended at `0x00001002`; with `skip_frames = 16`, output L/R were
  identical (`max_abs_lr_diff_steady_state = 0`) and Right input
  rejection was confirmed (`max_abs_output_when_left_zero = 0`,
  `max_abs_output_change_when_right_input_changes = 0`).
- **How to apply.** Future audio-format changes should preserve the
  external interface until the user explicitly approves a top-level /
  block-design migration. For guitar input, continue to treat Left as
  the mono source and keep AXI metadata propagation independent of
  sample values.

## D23 — HDMI GUI uses integrated AudioLab overlay and top-left 800x480 LCD viewport

- **Decision.** The live HDMI GUI path uses the integrated AudioLab
  `audio_lab.bit`; it must not load PYNQ `base.bit` or any second full
  overlay. For the current 5-inch 800x480 HDMI LCD, the adopted default
  visible viewport is the top-left `x=0,y=0,w=800,h=480` region inside
  the fixed 1280x720 HDMI framebuffer.
- **Why.** Phase 5A output mapping showed that the LCD does not behave
  like a clean full-frame 1280x720-to-800x480 scaler. User visual
  inspection confirmed the `800x480 x0 y0` candidate box is correctly
  positioned. Center placement `(240,120)` and further positive/negative
  offset sweeps are therefore not the normal runtime path.
- **Runtime contract.**
  - Load `AudioLabOverlay()` exactly once.
  - Use `audio_lab_pynq.hdmi_backend.AudioLabHdmiBackend`.
  - Use `GUI/pynq_multi_fx_gui.py::render_frame_800x480(...,
    variant="compact-v2")` for the default small-LCD frame.
  - Do not call `GUI/pynq_multi_fx_gui.py::run_pynq_hdmi()`.
  - Do not call `Overlay("base.bit")`.
  - Do not load another overlay after `AudioLabOverlay()`.
- **Current default command.**

  ```sh
  sudo env PYTHONPATH=/home/xilinx/Audio-Lab-PYNQ \
    python3 scripts/test_hdmi_800x480_frame.py \
      --variant compact-v2 --placement manual \
      --offset-x 0 --offset-y 0 --hold-seconds 60
  ```

- **Boundaries.** Native 800x480 HDMI timing remains a Phase 5B candidate,
  but it is not required for correct placement now. Any native-timing
  trial is a separate Vivado rebuild / timing-review / bit-hwh deploy
  decision. The old untracked `HDMI/` experiment tree was removed after
  confirming current deploy, tests, and runtime scripts use `GUI/` plus
  `audio_lab_pynq/hdmi_backend.py` instead.
